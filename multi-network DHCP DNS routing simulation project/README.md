# Multi-Network DHCP DNS Routing Simulation 🌐

---

## 1. Overview 📘

- This project implements a multi-network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer.

- It demonstrates DHCP and DNS server configuration across multiple interconnected networks.

- It simulates real-world enterprise network infrastructure.

- It includes routing, addressing, server configuration, and client connectivity.

---

## 2. Network Architecture 🧩

- The network consists of:

- Multiple independent networks

- Dedicated routers acting as default gateways

- Switches connecting end devices

- DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment

- DNS server for domain name resolution

- Wireless routers for wireless connectivity

- Smart devices and computers as clients
